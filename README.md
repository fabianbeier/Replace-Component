Replace a frame with an instance and copy over the text.

Just select one instance or one component and multiple frames that all share the same layout. Then run the plugin and all frames will be converted to instances. The cool thing is: all texts from the original frame will be copied over to the instance.

Requirement: The instance and the frame should contain the same amount of text-fields.
